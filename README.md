# -CS-454-01-Project-1
Part-A:
Started by downloading ubuntu for Windows as other options did not work

	1)- Configured AWS in Ubuntu using the CLI " aws configure " and inputting 
		1.) AWS Access Key:
		2.) AWS Secret Access Key: 
		3.) Domain region name: us-east-2
		4.) Default output format: text

	2)- After that replace the placeholder info in the CLI example with appropriate info.
		Then run in Ubuntu terminal which should result in getting the IP addresses.

Part-B:
 Input the CLI text in part-B the terminal after replacing placeholder text.
 Ran just fine for me.

Part-C:
 After inputting the provided CLI into the terminal. Was able to get it to say
	that it was " listening on 8080 ". And while it worked on a localhost8080
	it never was able to make a connection with the "curl" CLI even after 10 hours	
	of troubleshooting. Also for it to accept the "curl" CLI a second terminal was needed to be opened.

Part-D:  
 The CLI for part-D did not function, I can only assume it has something to do with 
	part-C not fulling working.

part-E:
 All test cases were able to go through the Localhost8080, and gave appropriate output.
